- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.

In insecure we donot have any way to go back and know what went wrong in the website.
Hence , here we are maintaining a secure log which has a custom mechanisms to secure the log which has every information about the incoming requests.
Due to this we will be able to save and keep track of the information.
So if any point there is a problem in the website we can console log the log file to see the error and counter it.


- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Make the log immutable.
Do something which can audit the logs.
