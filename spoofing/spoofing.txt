Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.


Spoofing involves impersonating a trusted source to deceive others. 
Secure versions prevent this by implementing authentication mechanisms, 
like email protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) or HTTPS with digital certificates, 
ensuring the legitimacy of sources and mitigating spoofing risks.
